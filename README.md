# Butterspy

Butterfly is a small library in the works for creating spies.

The idea is to have it help bring legacy systems under test, where first some behaviour of the system is excercised, some spies have been created upfront to record the actual interactions which afterwards can be used to generate Mockito or Spock expectations for unit- or integration test purposes.

_Work in progress_ ;-)
